# Short Description (JQuery Puzzle Game)
- Used in project for embeding iFrame with the Visual Composer (Wordpress)
- simple game made with Jquery massively inspired by https://goo.gl/bxcT76 awesome project!

# Contains
- index.hml, iframe.html and one folder /img

# Added
- Hover over image over text span

# Needs work (idea)
- Problem no.1 : Content is protruding outside of its containing element, under 560px and so is breaking the layout under smaller devices e.g. mobile viewers.
- Problem no.2 : Hover over image is positioned relative on #main content, and so it covers the puzzle, but when you hover over the h4 span, after moving the tiles it breaks and overlaps the image.
